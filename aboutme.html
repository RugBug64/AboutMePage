In order to achieve this goal, I will have to follow the path of my father, I will first need to attend a good university, and then work at a company for many years and demonstrate my skills. After that, I will be able to earn my title as "Distinguished Engineer". This is my career path because I have had expierience with programming ever since I was in elementary school and I find it satisfactory. In addition, I would like a high-paying job in order to keep living in the Bay Area.</p>
